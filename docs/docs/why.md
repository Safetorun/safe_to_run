:::caution

No solution to tamper detection is foolproof, if someone is able to decompile your application and
push it onto an unsuspecting device, it is possible remove the functionality of safe to run.

This just makes it that much harder...

:::

## Overview

Safe to run has been developed in order to simplify development of secure android applications. Safe
to run has two primary capabilities:

* Checking if the device is safe to run
* Providing a capability to verify intents, URLs and other types of vulnerable items

## Motivation

In particular the goal of the project is to provide a simple, configurable way for app developers to
define when an app should or should not run and a simple way of calling that check.

## Input verification

Input verification is intended to ensure that URLs are safe to load into webviews, or to make API
calls or that intents coming from external sources match some predefined conditions. Check the
documentation under 'input verification' to get started

## Checks

Safe to run consists of a number of 'checks' which are detailed in the documentation. The purpose of
these checks is to ensure that the app is 'safe to run' i.e. it meets the pre-conditions you have
set.

Following are a list of things that Safe to run can help protect against and the checks that can
help with them
