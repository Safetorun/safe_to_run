Safe to run supports two modes of operation. Default and reporting.

The recommended approach is to use the default option. I.e.

```kotlin
safeToRun(buildSafeToRunCheckList {
     add {
        banAvdEmulatorCheck()
     }
})
```

It also recommended that if you create a function for this check, that function should also be inlined. E.g.

```kotlin
private inline fun Context.canIRun(actionOnFailure: () -> Unit) =
      if (safeToRun(buildSafeToRunCheckList {
              add {
                  banAvdEmulatorCheck()
              }
       }).invoke()) {
          actionOnFailure()
      }
```

And then call this function, e.g. from your fragments or activities:

```kotlin
canIRun { throw RuntimeException() }
```

It is also recommended that you call this check more than once, in order to make it harder for attackers to reverse
engineer the application and remove safe to run checks.

### Reporting
Another approach is to use the SafeToRun reporting API. This provides a 'Safe to run report' which contains extra
information about any failures, and is particularly useful for providing error messages to developers about why
a check has failed. For example:


```kotlin
SafeToRun.init(
    configure {

        // Root beer (detect root)
        rootDetection {
            tolerateBusyBox = true
        }.error()

        // Black list certain apps
        blacklistConfiguration {
            +"com.abc.def"
            +packageName
            blacklistRootingApps()
        }.error()

        verifySignatureConfig("cSP1O3JN/8+Ag14WAOeOEnwAnpY=")
            .error()

        // OS Blacklist version
        osDetectionCheck(
            conditionalBuilder {
                with(minOsVersion(MIN_OS_VERSION))
                and(notManufacturer("Abc"))
                and(bannedModel("bannedModel"))
            }
        ).warn()

        osDetectionCheck(
            conditionalBuilder {
                with(bannedModel("Pixel 4a (5G)"))
            }
        ).warn()

        osDetectionCheck(banBluestacksEmulator()).error()

        installOriginCheckWithDefaults().warn()

        osDetectionCheck(banAvdEmulator()).error()
        debugCheck().warn()
    }
)
```

Then you can run a check from anywhere:

```kotlin
SafeToRun.isSafeToRun()
```

Whilst this is easier to use and easier to configure, it is also easier for reverse engineers to
bypass the checks no matter how many times you call `isSafeToRun` an attacker would only need to change
one bit of code to remove all checks


::: tip

Rule of thumb: Use the default check when using SafeToRun.
